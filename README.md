# What does Exohood mean?
The name "Exohood" embodies our ethos deriving from the Ancient Greek words "Exo" signifying the external or beyond, and "planets" the eternal wanderers of space. Our mission? To bring a seemingly alien technology to Earth, pushing the boundaries of science as we know it be it in physics, mathematics or chemistry.

Infusing the transformative powers of AI, Blockchain and Quantum technology, we endeavor to craft solutions that seem beyond the realms of today's understanding. But it's not just about forging the future; it's about ensuring equitable access to it. Channeling the spirit of "Hood," inspired by the legendary Robin Hood, we see ourselves as the extraterrestrial vanguards of science. We aim to democratize information, ensuring free access and global participation.

In essence, Exohood is not just a technological force; it's a movement. We're here to redistribute the wonders of advanced science, ensuring that the fruits of our interstellar journey benefit all of humanity.
