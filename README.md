# Exohood Protocol

- Exohood is an open source protocol on github that generates value for the decentralized ecosystem through building applications, games, services and solutions.

# How Exohood Works?

- Exohood is an organization represented by rules encoded as a transparent computer program, controlled by the organization members, and not influenced by a central government. A DAO's financial transaction record and program rules are maintained on a blockchain.

# How to start build?

# How to contribute?
