# Reporting Security Issues

This document outlines security procedures and general policies for public code repositories
in the `Exohood Labs` organization.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you have found a security issue in one of our public repositories, we ask you to report it
through our responsible disclosure program. You can find the full description of the program
from "Coming Soon".

### Alternative means of contact

If you prefer to get in touch via e-mail.

Note that direct reports over e-mail will not reach our managed bug bounty program and
are not rewardable.
